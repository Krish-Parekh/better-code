# Two Sum

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return **indices of the two numbers** such that they add up to `target`.

You may assume that each input would have **exactly one solution**, and you may not use the same element twice.  
You can return the answer in **any order**.

---

## Input Format
- `nums`: an array of integers  
- `target`: an integer

### Example Input
```
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9
```

---

## Output Format
- Return an array (or list) of two integers representing the **indices** of the elements whose sum equals `target`.

### Example Output
```
[0, 1]
```

### Explanation
Because `nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9`, the output is `[0, 1]`.

---

## Constraints
- `2 <= nums.length <= 10^5`  
- `-10^9 <= nums[i], target <= 10^9`  
- Exactly **one valid answer** exists.

---

## Follow-Ups
- Can you come up with an algorithm that has **O(n)** time complexity?  
- How would you handle the case if there could be **multiple pairs** instead of exactly one?  
- What if the array is **already sorted**—could you use a two-pointer approach?

## Complexity
| Approach | Time | Space |
|-----------|------|--------|
| Brute Force | O(n²) | O(1) |
| Hash Map (Optimal) | O(n) | O(n) |
